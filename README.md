# User registration and login with Flask, React and JWT
___

This project is a basic implementation of JWT based persistent Authentication/Authorization.

On the backend we have a `Flask` web server to generate and sign our token on authentication to the `/login` endpoint.

On the front end we are using `ReactJS` And we are storing the token in the application state using hooks and the context api.
